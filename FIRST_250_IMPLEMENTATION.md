## Technical Implementation

### Frontend State Management:
```typescript
const [spotsRemaining, setSpotsRemaining] = useState<number | null>(null);
const [loadingSpots, setLoadingSpots] = useState(true);

useEffect(() => {
  if (isOpen) {
    fetchRemainingSpots();
  }
}, [isOpen]);
```

### API Integration:
```typescript
// Fetch on modal open
const response = await fetch('/api/waitlist/count');
const data = await response.json();
setSpotsRemaining(data.remaining);

// Update after signup
const signupResponse = await fetch('/api/waitlist', { ... });
const signupData = await signupResponse.json();
setSpotsRemaining(signupData.remaining);
```

### Firestore Count Query:
```typescript
const waitlistSnapshot = await db.collection('waitlist').count().get();
const totalSignups = waitlistSnapshot.data().count;
const remaining = Math.max(0, TOTAL_SPOTS - totalSignups);
```

---

## Configuration

### Change Total Spots:
In both files, update the constant:
```typescript
const TOTAL_SPOTS = 250; // Change to 500, 1000, etc.
```

**Files to update:**
- `/app/api/waitlist/count/route.ts`
- `/app/api/waitlist/route.ts`

### Adjust Pricing:
In `/components/UpgradeModal.tsx`:
```tsx
<span><strong>50% OFF first month</strong> (₹149 instead of ₹299)</span>
```

---

## Testing

### Test Counter Display:

1. **Open modal** - Should fetch and display count
2. **Check loading state** - Should show "..." while loading
3. **Verify count** - Should match Firestore count
4. **Test fallback** - Shows "250" if fetch fails

### Test Counter Update:

1. **Sign up** - Submit email
2. **Check success message** - Should mention "Founding Member"
3. **Verify counter decreases** - Should show updated count
4. **Open modal again** - Should show same updated count

### Test Edge Cases:

1. **No signups** - Should show "250 spots remaining"
2. **249 signups** - Should show "1 spot remaining"
3. **250+ signups** - Should show "0 spots remaining"
4. **API error** - Should show fallback "250"

---

## Monitoring & Analytics

### Key Metrics to Track:

1. **Conversion Rate**
   - Modal opens → Signups
   - Target: >40%

2. **Time to Convert**
   - Modal open → Signup time
   - Faster = more urgency working

3. **Counter Effect**
   - Conversion rate as spots decrease
   - Hypothesis: Higher urgency = Higher conversion

4. **Drop-off Points**
   - Where users leave without signing up
   - Optimize those areas

### Recommended Tracking:

```typescript
// Add to modal open
analytics.track('first_250_modal_opened', {
  spots_remaining: spotsRemaining,
  timestamp: new Date()
});

// Add to signup
analytics.track('first_250_signup', {
  spots_remaining: spotsRemaining,
  email: email,
  timestamp: new Date()
});
```

## Revenue Projections

### Assumptions:
- Total spots: 250
- Conversion rate: 40% (100 paying)
- Pro plan: ₹299/month
- First month: ₹149 (50% off)
- Average retention: 6 months

### Calculations:

**First Month Revenue:**
```
100 users × ₹149 = ₹14,900
```

**Month 2-6 Revenue (per month):**
```
100 users × ₹299 = ₹29,900
```

**6-Month Total:**
```
₹14,900 + (₹29,900 × 5) = ₹164,400
```

**Annual Projection (with 70% retention):**
```
70 users × ₹299 × 12 = ₹2,51,160
```

**Lifetime Value per Founding Member:**
```
Assuming 12-month average:
(₹149 + ₹299 × 11) / 12 = ₹286.42/month
LTV = ₹3,437 per user
```
