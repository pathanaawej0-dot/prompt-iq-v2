// In waitlist API route
const discountCode = `LAUNCH50-${generateShortCode()}`;

await db.collection('waitlist').add({
  email,
  source: 'upgrade_button',
  discount_code: discountCode,
  discount_percentage: 50,
  expires_at: new Date(Date.now() + 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000), // 7 days
  created_at: FieldValue.serverTimestamp(),
  notified: false,
  converted: false
});
```

## Revenue Projections

### Assumptions:
- Waitlist signups: 100 users
- Launch conversion: 25%
- Pro plan price: ₹499/month
- Discount: 50% first month

### Calculations:
```
Paying customers: 100 × 25% = 25 users
First month revenue: 25 × ₹249.50 = ₹6,237.50
Second month revenue: 25 × ₹499 = ₹12,475
Annual value: 25 × ₹499 × 12 = ₹1,49,700

Break-even: Month 2
LTV per customer: ₹5,988 (assuming 12-month retention)
```
